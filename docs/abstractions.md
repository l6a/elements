## Derivability of Data

Derivability is the degree of something can be calculated or obtained
from something else.
The concept is applicable to things more general than just math,
including data and data processing.

* Given an experiment setup, is it possible to obtain the same data?

* Given some source codes, is it possible to run the same analysis?

* Given some data and codes, is it possible to reach the same results?
